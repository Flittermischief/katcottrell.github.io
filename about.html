			<h1>About Kat Cottrell</h1>
			<p>Hello!  I'm Katherine "Kat" Cottrell.  I attend Duke University as a computer science 
				student.  I am set to graduate with my bachelor of science by Spring 2022.  I 
				have special interest in data science, data visualization, and image analysis.  
				In my spare time I create visual art, code, and spend quality time with my two cats.</p>

					<strong>Pumpkin</strong>
					<br>
					This is Pumpkin.  After years of working in industry as a senior engineer at 
					Google, he has returned to academia to pursue his passion for parallel 
					computation and memory systems.  Pumpkin also volunteers his time leading 
					a thinktank for global gender equality in STEM.

					<strong>Spooky</strong>
					<br>
					This is Spookiloo "Spooky."  Spooky is a Rhodes Scholar and a former college 
					football star.  After a sports injury forced him to retire from football, 
					Spooky returned to school for an advanced degree in electrical engineering and 
					is now a tenured faculty member at the Institute for Advanced Study's school 
					of mathematics researching space-efficient local computation algorithms.
